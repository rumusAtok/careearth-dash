# careearth-dash

A simple dashboard about Earth temperature around the globe and Malaysia from 1900s until 2000s. Included with the dashboard is anomalies and prediction using Facebook Prophet and Tableau simple exponential smoothing. 
There are some of the main benefits of using Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting:

Easy to use: Prophet has a simple, intuitive API that makes it very easy to generate forecasts quickly. It abstracts away much of the complexity of building forecasting models.
Fast: It is optimized to handle very large datasets and generate forecasts very quickly. This makes iterative modeling and testing faster.
Open source: Prophet is open source software released under the MIT license. This means it's free to use and customize as needed.


Tableau's simple exponential smoothing functionality provides some useful benefits for time series forecasting:

Easy to configure: Tableau provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface and menu options to quickly apply simple exponential smoothing. Users don't have to code complex statistical calculations.
Adaptive forecasts: The exponential smoothing adjusts forecasts dynamically based on recent trend and seasonality in the data. This allows adapting to changes.
Responsive to trends: The method is designed to closely follow both upward and downward trends in historical data. This helps forecasts match trajectory.

Data acquired are open-source from various websites and by using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the data can be cleaned and modelled. The dashboard was created using Tableau with easy navigation and user-friendly approach to reach out general audiences. Using provided open workspace provided by Tableau, the dashboard can be uploaded to Tableau Public in order to host the dashboard online and accessible to many people.
